# PREDICTION-OF-MAANG-STOCKS

This is our academic project for CSP-571 "Data Preparation And Analysis". In this project we aimed to find the stock prices for the next 10 days allowing users to make decision 
to buy or sell stocks of M-A-A-N-G (META-APPLE-AMAZON-NETFLIX-GOOGLE) companies. We performed various visulisation techniques to get to know the dataset. At last we have 
statistically modelled it and visualised the prediction trend for the next few days. 

## DATASETS:

This project works on R based environment and scraps the data directly from Yahoo Finance. This generates the stock data of all the companies that you want to extract.

## MODELLING:

We have statistically modelled using R packages, calculated the F1-score, MSE, RMSE, and R-squared value, based on all this it predicts the values for the next 10 days and plots the 
predicted and actual values as graph to understand how accurate the predicted values were. The models that were used are:

1. Linear Regression	

2. SVM

3. Decision trees

4. Random Forest

5. Gradient boosting models

Each of the following models, is subjected to the dataset obtained from MAANG companies.
